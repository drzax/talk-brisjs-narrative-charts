- Genesis
  - XKCD
  - Inspiration strikes: ICAC
  - Search for implementations: [found](https://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~n2iskand/?page_id=13)
    - Unfortunately, not open source, but pretty awesome
    - Lets re-create.

  - Full circle: got to use it on Star Wars!

- Caveat: It's been more than a year since I seriously worked on this code.
- Caveat: this implementation is messy and terrible, but for the most part, it works.
  - Please help me! I got in super deep on this one and I'm far from sure this is the best solution. Got an idea how it could be done better? Tell me. Tell me now, tell me later, tell me via a comment on GitHub. I'm interested.

- So what's the challenge here?
  - Order characters and position scenes in a way which minimises the disorder.

- My approach
  - What's the basic algorithm?
  - What are the interesting parts?
  - Code walkthrough of interesting parts.

- What would I do different?
  - I'd like to try it again taking an approach which uses a more pure 'energy' function. See for example [d3-labeler](https://github.com/tinker10/D3-Labeler)
